# Media request

Media request is a feature on Fossabot that allows your viewers to request media from [**YouTube**](https://youtube.com) or [**SoundCloud**](https://soundcloud.com) that will play on stream.

Fossabot's media request system is built to be customizable and adapt to the needs of any community. This documentation resource helps you get the most out of our media request system.
