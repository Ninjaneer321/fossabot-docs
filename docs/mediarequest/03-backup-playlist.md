# Backup playlist

Fossabot features a backup playlist that allows you to define songs that can be picked at random when there are no viewer requests left in the queue.

By default, Fossabot provides a playlist of [**Monstercat Music**](https://youtube.com/@Monstercat) for you to use.

:::warning Comply with copyright law!

While Monstercat is a vendor that provides great creator friendly music, you must still purchase a [**Monstercat Gold**](https://www.monstercat.com/gold) license to play it on stream. Fossabot is not responsible for your adherence to copyright and local law, nor provides a license for its users.

Twitch also suggests a list of [**alternative music sources here**](https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/music-options-for-streamers).

## Importing from YouTube

You may import an existing YouTube playlist into your backup playlist.
